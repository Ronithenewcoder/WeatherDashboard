# WeatherDashboard
The weather dashboard is a web application that provides real time weather information for cities. Users can enter a city name in the search box and a 5-day forecast, with temperature, humidity, and wind speed details. My motivation for creating this website is to help those who have plans, but also need to see if the weather affects them.

## User Story
